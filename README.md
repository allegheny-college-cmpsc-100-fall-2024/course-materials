## Course Description

### Catalog Description

An introduction to the principles of computer science with an emphasis on creative expression through the medium of a programming language. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students learn the computational structures needed to solve problems and produce computational artifacts which address these problems in real-world contexts. Students also learn how to organize and document a program's source code so that it effectively communicates with the intended users and maintainers. Additionally, the introduction includes an overview of the discipline of computer science and computational thinking. During a weekly laboratory session students use industry-grade technology to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions. Prerequisite: None. Distribution Requirements: ME, SP.

### Additional Description

This section of CMPSC-100 uses the VPython library to facilitate a creative and visual approach to learning Python. VPython is a lightweight 3D module that allows students to create three-dimensional image renderings with just a few lines of code. Because this class approaches coding from a creative angle, it emphasizes not just the how of coding but the why behind creating one project versus another.

This class focuses on applications right away, operating on the premise that the ability to write functional code as soon as possible will facilitate future abstract and theoretical understanding. In other words, we approach coding as something best learned by doing. The way computer science is presented often includes a sort of genius mystique that excludes a lot of people. In reality, no one knows everything there is to know about computer science. In addition, programming languages are created by humans with human flaws.

Frustration is part of it. Inside confusion lie the seeds of understanding. The sensation where your brain hurts is a sign that your brain is working, just like a muscle. This class presents computer science as something that is indisputably powerful and useful, but no more rarefied than any other discipline. To write excellent code is a fantastic goal, but ultimately the thing that matters most is what that code does in the world.

### Learning Outcomes

Students who earn a C or better in this course will achieve the following objectives:

#### Scientific Process (SP)

1.  Apply Python programming principles to execute and explain computer code that implements interactive, novel solutions to a variety of computable problems
2.  Release code consistent with industry-standard practices using professional grade IDEs, command line tools, and version control tools.
3.  Analyze and suggest revisions to existing Python language code to improve or add functionality

#### Modes of Expression (ME)

1.  Evaluate the practical and ethical implications of writing computer code and discuss the contexts, perceived effects, and impacts exerted on and by computer code as a cultural force or artifact
2.  Design, describe, and implement original projects incorporating standard practices and Python language principles

## Required materials

### Laptop

A department-approved laptop, with an adequate charge, is required in every class session.

The laptop requirements are avaialable [here](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/resources/laptops/#:~:text=Department%20Approved%20Laptops&text=In%20order%20to%20successfully%20complete,10%20or%2011%2064%2Dbit). If you don't have a laptop that meets these specifications, you can request to borrow one using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSds-N61LLpYpZZBunlR_JigGH9eOBxvZfpEV71o73DyhTDQvw/viewform). The department has a limited number of loaner laptops available, so the earlier you request, the better!

### Textbook(s)

There are no physical textbooks for this course. Any texts or articles used will be available online or distributed in class. 

### Platforms

This course relies on GitHub, Discord and Trinket.io. Your work will be assigned and evaluated using these platforms and official course communication will take place through them. You are expected to sign up for accounts and remain active on these platforms throughout the semester.

## Assignments & Evaluation

### Specifications Grading

This course uses a version **specifications grading**. This means that instead of receiving points for different assignments and a weighted average, each assignment receives a grade of either **satisfactory** or **unsatisfcatory**.You will also earn **engagement points** for attending and engaging in class, and these points can either increase or lower your grade. 

Each assignment is bundled into a certain category. To achieve a certain letter grade, you must receive satisfactory marks on the required number of assignments for that grade.

You can miss a limited amount of assignments under this policy, and **tokens** will also allow for a few late or resubmitted assignments. See below for detailed information on how assignment completion leads to different grades. 

### Assignments & Quizzes

This course will include eight problem sets, six quizzes, two projects, and three challenges. To receive a certain grade, receive a satisfactory on the appropriate number of assignments, as indicated below. 

These grading criteria are subject to change, but changes should never reduce your chances of a higher grade. 

| Grade | Problem Sets          | Projects + Challenges | Quizzes               |
| ----- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| A     | Satisfactory on 7 / 8 | Satisfactory on 5 / 5 | Satisfactory on 5 / 6 |
| B     | Satisfactory on 6 / 8 | Satisfactory on 4 / 5 | Satisfactory on 4 / 6 |
| C     | Satisfactory on 5 / 8 | Satisfactory on 3 / 5 | Satisfactory on 3 / 6 |
| D     | Satisfactory on 4 / 8 | Satisfactory on 2 / 5 | Satisfactory on 2 / 6 |

If you receive checkmarks for different grade levels in different columns, an average will be taken. This may lead to a +/- added to your grade.  

#### Gatorgrade

Gatorgrade is a tool developed by the Allegheny College CIS department to automatically grade assignments and give students immediate feedback. 

Gatorgrade results should be considered preliminary. Projects grades may include some Gator checks to help you stay on track, but crucial parts of your grade for these assignments will be determined by the professor. Even assignments that are primarily evaulated through gatorgrade are not final until otherwise noted. 

Sometimes, Gatorgrade will make a mistake. Don't hesitate to let the professor know if you suspect an issue. 

### Engagement Grade

The scoring for engagmenet has changed from a weekly average to a simple letter grade. You can see the archived version [here](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-100-fall-2024/course-materials/tree/archive?tab=readme-ov-file#engagement-points). 

You can receive engagement points by:

- Attending class and completing entrace/exit tickets. 
  - Tickets will be assigned during class, and cannot be completed outside of class time. They are the primary form of attendance tracking, which will be supplemented by visual confirmation that student is present.
  - Tickets come in different forms, such as Google Forms, Discord threads, and short Github/Trinket assignments. You receive points for completing these assignments regardless of correctness, but you must at least attempt to respond to the prompt given to ensure points. 
- Speaking in class (answering a question, asking a question, conributing to a discussion, responding to a prompt etc.) 
- Speaking with professor one-on-one during lab time or open work time
- Attending professor office hours
- Presenting a project (earns 5 points)
  
To get an A on your engagement score, you will complete enough tickets to reflect that you have missed no more than two weeks of class throughout the semester. You should also particiate in class and/or go to office hours about once a week, on average.  

Your engagement grade affect your grade as follows:

| Average Weekly Points | Grade Impact                               | 
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| A                  | Adds half a letter grade, if possible      | 
| B                    | No impact                                  |
| C                    | Subtracts half a letter grade, if possible |
| Less than a C                   | Subtracts a full letter grade              |


This system means that you can miss roughly two weeks of class without consequence, assuming you are participating in class each week. Note that this accomodation is meant to cover emergencies, and additional absences may not be excused. 

**As an exception: if you are sick with something contagious, you should not come to class even if you have already missed the permitted two weeks. If this is your situation, please contact your professor. In most situations, the ~two week allowance already in place will allow you to stay home when sick without consequence or having to contact professor. ** 

You will receive regular updates on your weekly average points so you can adjust your participation accordingly.  

See department policies for more information on attendance. 

### Tokens and Late Assignments

**Late assignments will not be accepted unless a token is applied at least 24 hours before the assignment deadline.** 

**These tokens are no-questions-asked.** They are meant to accomodate emergency situations, so there is no need to provide an excuse when applying a token. 

You will have 4 tokens, and each can do one of the following:

- Extends **one assignment**'s deadline by one week

  OR

- Allows resubmit of **one project** assignment one week after receiving your grade. Resubmits can only be used on projects where an on-time attempt was made.

  OR

- Allows you to make-up **one quiz** during professor office hours within two weeks of the orignal quiz date. In this case, the token must be applied the day before the quiz date. 

Each token is active and usable for a limited period:

| Token | Active Period       |
| ----- | ------------------- |
| 1     | August 27 - Sept 15 |
| 2     | Sept 16 - Oct 6     |
| 3     | Oct 7 - Oct 27      |
| 4     | Oct 28 - Nov 24     |

If you apply a token to an assignment with multiple intermittent deadlines, all deadlines that occur 24+ hours after the token is applied will be extended by one week. 

The final project must be turned in on time. Tokens cannot be applied. 

See department policies for more information on tokens. 

## Course Policies

See department policies for more information on the below. 

### Illness and Wellness, Mental and Physical

**If you think you may be sick, stay home** —- particularly if your symptoms suggest a contagious illness (i.e. cough, fever, sneezing, sore throat). For more information about missed class and sickness, see CIS department policies. 

#### Mental Health

As a college student, there may be times when personal stressors, struggles, and/or traumas interfere with your academic performance and/or negatively impact your daily life. Allegheny College recognizes that mental health is an important piece of the holistic human experience, and that this experience influences your academic success. We encourage students to prioritize their mental well-being by seeking services and support as needed.

If you are dealing with something contagious or that requires accomodations I can provide, let me know. In addition, you should communicate me if life circumstances are preventing you from fully engaging with the course. Otherwise, I don't require details, and the above policies are meant to create space fo the inevitable disruptions of daily life. Processing certain details may lie beyond my professional expertise, and I want to do my best to serve you in my capacity as your professor. If emergencies disruptions interfere with your course work to an extent that the above policies are insufficient, please make an office hours appointment. In these cases, requeseting a late drop (X) or incomplete (I) in the course may be the most appropriate option. 

Students who are in need of mental health support can access free, confidential services and resources in the Counseling and Personal Development Center (CPDC). CPDC delivers holistic mental health services to the Allegheny College student campus community through brief individual and group counseling, crisis support, outreach programming, consultation, and coordination of care. Students may request services by submitting a form on CPDC’s website (sites.allegheny.edu/counseling). Students may also connect with a mental health clinician at any time by calling Allegheny’s 24/7 line: 814-332-2105. If you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health emergency, please call the 24/7 line, Public Safety (814-332-3357), or 911. When in doubt, reach out.

### Assistance with course concepts

Students who struggle to understand knowledge and skills defined in this course are encouraged to seek assistance from the course instructor. Students who need the course instructor’s assistance can schedule an appointment through their Office Hour Calendar near the top of this page.

### Academic Alerts

Allegheny College uses an Academic Alert system to send progress notices to the class deans in the Maytum Center for Student Success (MCSS). The progress notices are not punitive. They are an opportunity to connect you with your class dean who can offer additional support and suggest resources if you need assistance. These notices may encourage faculty advisors, coaches (for student-athletes), or other support staff to provide outreach to you as well.

### Classroom ethics

The discipline of computer science, like many others, encourages its members to act according to discipline-specific ethics. I encourage you to take time to review the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) [Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf).

### Allegheny College Statement of Community

Allegheny College also expects students and faculty to act according to its Statement of Community:

> Allegheny students and employees are committed to creating an inclusive, respectful and safe residential learning community that will actively confront and challenge racism, sexism, heterosexism, religious bigotry, and other forms of harassment and discrimination. We encourage individual growth by promoting a free exchange of ideas in a setting that values diversity, trust and equality. So that the right of all to participate in a shared learning experience is upheld, Allegheny affirms its commitment to the principles of freedom of speech and inquiry, while at the same time fostering responsibility and accountability in the exercise of these freedoms. This statement does not replace existing personnel policies and codes of conduct.

Keep both of these standards in mind as you exercise your academic inquiry in this course. These serve as our fundamental "first principles" in pursuit of our shared academic goals.

### Honor Code

All students and faculty at Allegheny College are bound by the Honor Code. Everyone expects that your behavior reflects this commitment. Given the eminently shareable and reproducible nature of code, the Department of Computer Science adds the following statement to the general college policy:

> It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course, and particularly in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with teachers, student assistants, and fellow students. Such dialogue is encouraged. However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others, and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else’s work. It will therefore be understood that all assignments submitted to faculty of the Department of Computer Science are to be the original work of the student submitting the assignment, and should be signed in accordance with the provisions of the Honor Code. Appropriate action will be taken when assignments give evidence that they were derived from the work of others.

As the nature of "plagiarism" and constituents of "fair use" change often, the department encourages you to periodically review the specific tenets of the general college Honor Code provided in the latest course catalog and in the *Compass* .

The above statement, of course, also applies to online forums such as Stack Overflow, et al.

### Artificial Intelligence in Class

Because this is a 100 level class where practice is critical, use of artificial intelligence to generate code is not permitted unless otherwise stated in a particular assignment. Students may be asked to supply verbal explanations of assignments to supplement their code. 

See department policies for information on using AI assistance on class assignments. 

### Religious Observance

If you need to miss class or reschedule a final examination due to a religious observance, please speak to the professor well in advance to make arrangements. Please see [https://sites.allegheny.edu/religiouslife/religious-holy-days/](https://sites.allegheny.edu/religiouslife/religious-holy-days/) for more details.

### Educational Accommodations

Students with disabilities who believe they may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact Student Accessibility and Support Services (SASS) at (814) 332-2898. Student Accessibility and Support Services is located in Pelletier Library. Please do this as soon as possible to ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion. Please see [https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentaccessibility/](https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentaccessibility/) for more details.
