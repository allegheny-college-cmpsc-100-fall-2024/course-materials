## Data Types in Python

Variables have different data types. Python assigns the data type of a variable based on its value. These are some common datatypes:

### string
Strings are text values. If a variable's value is surrounded with `'` or `"`, Python gives data type `string`

```
pet1 = "dog"
pet2 = 'cat'
```
>[!NOTE]
> If Python sees a word WITHOUT quotation marks, it will look for a variable with that name. If it doesn't find one, it will throw an error. 

### int

Ints are integer numerical values.  If a variable is assigned number value with no quotes and no decimal point, Python gives it data type `int`.

```
i = 2
```


### float

Floats are decimal numerical values. If a variable is assigned number value with no quotes and a decimal point, Python gives it data type `float`. 

```
f = 5.2
```
