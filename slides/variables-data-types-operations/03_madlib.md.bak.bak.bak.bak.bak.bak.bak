Create a remix of the trinket [linked](https://trinket.io/python/3eaeec768d) in the Discord channel and follow the instructions in the code comments! When you're finished, reply to the Discord thread with your remixed Trinket. Once you've submitted your Trinket, you'll select another student's link from the thread to read to your table. 

**If you can't see our class Discord channel**, make sure you have signed up for Discord and completed the Course Platforms assignment. E-mail the professor your Discord name so they can add you right away.
