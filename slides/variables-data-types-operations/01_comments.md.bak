# Code Comments

- Code comments are text in your code files that Python ignores. 
- They are excellent for explaning what your code does, and for temporarily silencing code you may not want to delete. 
- In this class, we will use more comments than a professional would, because erring on the side of over-explaning is a great way to learn.
